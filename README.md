# anomalies_detection_model
This Neural Network was built to predict the future behavior of a group of merchants in intervals of two hours. Then, the script takes those predictions and estimate a minimum and maximum TPV for that point of the time, if the real value is out of the area between the minimum and maximum then it raises a visual alarm.
